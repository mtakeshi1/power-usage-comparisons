# power-usage-comparisons

Small project to compare power usage of different stacks for a small rest api endpoint

# Motivation

In 2017, a group of researchers from Portugal released a paper comparing commonly used programming languages by their
electricity usage while running a benchmark called 'The computer language benchmarks game'. The paper is great and I
encourage everyone (interested in green software) to read it, as it tries to answer many interesting questions, such as:

- faster programs are always the most energy efficient?
- how does memory usage relate to energy consumption?

But he main question it tried to answer is: what is the most 'green' programming language?

I won't delve into the results (which are very insteresting and cathegorize the programming languages in combination of
characteristics where they excel at) as the paper is easy to find and more importantly easy to read. However, I do have
some minor issues with it:

- the workload is not, in my opinion, a good representation of 99% of application written nowadays and they mostly favor
  native compilation
- the way it was measured (power usage for a single shot execution) favors 'startup' speed, but most web application
  nowadays are long lived, so it would make sense to measure power usage after warmup for JIT compiled languages (java,
  javascript/typescript, jruby)
- the quality of the softwares used varied greatly, likely giving advantage to more popular languages

Most of the time, current web application or api based application are not going to be limited by CPU, and will most
likely be waiting for IO.
Therefore, I'm proposing a different benchmark: a rest based API backed by a PosgreSQL database and serializing data
using JSON, a very typical stack.

# Implementation Details

The api has only a few endpoints that should be mostly straightforward and the open API yaml can be
found [here](https://github.com/mtakeshi1/power-usage-comparisons/blob/main/openapi.yaml) and the json version can be
found [here](https://github.com/mtakeshi1/power-usage-comparisons/blob/main/openapi.json)

I will publish them on github pages but very friefly:

```
/products
/products/{id}
/order/new (there's a json payload with the items)
/order/{id}
```

An implementation of this API should follow very basic rules:

- no caching
- stateless
- it doesn't need to do anything special, but it should compute the total price properly (which means making a number of
  queries when a new order is posted)

# Database

A database dump can be
found [here](https://github.com/mtakeshi1/power-usage-comparisons/blob/main/scripts/database.sql). I personally use
docker and start it as following:

```
docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_USER=myself -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysafepassword -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase -p 5432:5432 -v $PWD/scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ --name pgsql postgres:14.7
```

from the folder containing the scripts/ directory. Keep in mind to take notice of the user/password/database/port
combinations you used to configure your application

# Benchmark Method

The power usage will be measured using intel RAPL (same as in the paper) and exported
using [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) and for each implementation these will be the
steps:

- start scaphandre on the test server
- take a baseline power measure for roughly 1 hour (the server will be mostly idle but I imagine it will still draw some
  power). This will be deducted from the power usage when running the application
- start a fresh database (not in the same server as the application)
- run benchmark for an hour
- stop everything and collect measures (subtracting the power usage from the baseline measure before)

Each 'request' will actually be four http requests:

- GET to /products
- GET to 5 random products
- POST to /order/new with the 5 products
- GET to /order/{id}

I will run three separate workloads:

- cold start: a single thread making 1 request per second for 10 minutes
- hot application, low load: after warmup, without restarting the application, 10 threads making 1 request per second
- hot application, medium load: after warmup, without restarting the application, 100 threads making 2 request per
  second

There are a couple more tests that I want to make, but not sure if I will get to:

- hot application, maximum load: X threads making requests non-stop
- GraalVM native compilation has been getting a lot of attention lately, but native compilation takes a long time and
  uses a lot of CPU. I would like to know how many requests it takes for the Hotspot (or graalvm) JIT to be more energy
  efficient taking the native compilation into account

# Implementations:

## Java + Quarkus

First implementation and the one I used to generate the openapi and database schema (that's the reason the constraints
have such funky names, as they were generated by hibernate). To start it, from the command line, run

```
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

Running on a dev environment like above will create a fresh PostgreSQL database (using test container), create the
schema and start serving on port 8080. To populate the database:

```
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/products/random
```

To access the openapi ui, point your browser at [swagger ui here](http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/)

To run in 'production', pack your application ```./gradlew build```, create a .env file with details on the database
you're using:

```
quarkus.datasource.username = myself
quarkus.datasource.password = mysafepassword
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase

```

and run with ```java -jar ./build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar``` it should start listening on port 8080 (but the swagger
ui will not be available)
